# Time Tracking Software

## Build

After starting a second page (task managing) it was obvious that I would need to modularize the app. Mainly because the data store between the pages should be separated. To avoid using a build tool, which would add some setup complexity costs and a special build step after changes to publish it to basex, I tried X-Templates and inline-templates (see https://medium.com/js-dojo/7-ways-to-define-a-component-template-in-vuejs-c04e0c72900d ). But that does not seem to work with components that are nested in the app. String-Templates are a nogo for non-trivial components, because of lacking syntax-highlighting.

So, time to switch to single file vue-components and simple build-chain.

## vue-cli 3
